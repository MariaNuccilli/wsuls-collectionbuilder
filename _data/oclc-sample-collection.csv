oclcsample,coll0082,Page 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Technical Advisory Service for Images  Advice Paper  Scanners  Putting you in the picture – digital images in education © TASI · Last reviewed - July 2002  ? All scanners have the following components in common: an optical system, a  light sensor, an interface and driver software. Exactly what form these components  take and how they are arranged is what differentiates the scanner types. The quality  of the scan obtainable is primarily dependent on the quality of the optics and the  light detector, but the productivity is mainly reliant on the interface and driver  Scanners are the most common digital capture device, their purpose being to  convert light (which we see when we look at something) into ‘0’s and ‘1’s that we can  store and use in a computer. Or put more simply, scanners convert analogue  images into digital image files.  The large fall in cost of scanners over the last decade means that they are no longer  the specialist item they once were. However the range of prices and specifications  of the scanners on the market can easily confuse the potential buyer. The different  types of scanner (flatbed, film, drum and others) only adds to the confusion.  Before examining the different types of scanner, lets take a look at the underlying  technology and consider some of the issues that need to be considered when  choosing and using them.  Resolution  Resolution is probably the specification that causes most confusion for newcomers  to scanning. It is simply a measure of the ability to capture detail within the original  work.  Scanner manufacturers normally specify two figures for this parameter: ‘optical’ and  ‘interpolated’ – however only the ‘optical’ figure gives a true indication of a scanner’s  capabilities.  For scanners that use Charge Coupled Devices (CCD) as the sensor, the optical  resolution is limited by the number of elements (pixels) in the detector array and how  the array is moved relative to the image. Resolution is specified by the number of  separate and distinct samples that the sensor can make in every inch and therefore  measured in samples per inch (spi), although often the more generic ‘dpi’ (dots per  inch) is given by manufacturers.  The figure given for ‘interpolated’ resolution is a result of the scanner software  'guessing' the values between pixels and presenting these intermediate values as  'real' values. This process gives no extra image information but merely smoothes  the visual information and increases the size of the file. There are very few times  when this process is in any way useful and when it is; it can be better undertaken  within image processing software. So, remember that when assessing a scanner’s  resolution, it is only the ‘optical’ figure that should be taken into account.",,2011-02-22,2011-02-22,http://cdm17409.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/oclcsample/id/82,82,83.pdfpage,/oclcsample/image/83.pdfpage
oclcsample,coll0083,Page 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Putting you in the picture – digital images in education © TASI · Last reviewed - July 2002  Many scanners have their optical resolution specified as two figures: 1200 x 2400  spi. When this is the case, it is only the first and lower figure that gives the actual  size (and resolution) of the CCD. The second figure is the smallest distance that the  CCD element can be moved before it takes another reading (called the  addressability). If this distance is smaller than the actual element itself then, again,  interpolation is used to create the missing data. It is therefore only the lower figure  that gives an honest guide of the resolution capabilities of the scanner.  As there is very little or no standardisation of presentation of an input device’s  specification, it is not surprising that manufacturers try every method that they can to  make their scanners appear and sound as good as possible. When assessing the  specifications of the scanner, it is important that one always makes sure that the  figures are being compared in a standardised way to give a like-with-like  comparison.  Colour Depth  The ‘colour depth’ or ‘bit depth’ of a scanner is an indication of the range of colours  that can be captured by the scanner (See TASI Notes: The Digital Image). It does  not define the limits of the colour gamut (colour space) that is readable by the device  (which is dependant upon the physical characteristics of the device) but simply  specifies the number of separate definable colours that can be accurately described  within it.  A higher figure will equate to a more accurate description of the colours available to  the scanner but does not necessarily mean that they are available to the user at the  end of process. Scanners will often capture at a larger ‘bit depth’ of 36-42Bit and  then save or export from the scanner in standard 24Bit RGB colour. This extended  colour depth is used internally by the scanner to produce the best possible quality  original image data but is not normally available to the user. Although recently, there  has been a move towards some scanners (with the appropriate software) allowing  the full size ‘hi-bit’ version of the file to be saved and edited as a 48Bit TIFF or PNG.  Again the manufacturers have little agreement about the best way of specifying a  scanner’s colour depth. Some manufacturers give the number of bits for each colour  channel (8-16 Bit/channel), whilst others prefer to give the number of bits for all  colour channels (24-48Bit), either is accurate as long as you make sure you  compare like-with-like.  The colour depth, in itself, does not provide much evidence of the quality of the  scanner, however it does give some guide to how capable the scanner might be if it  can use all the colour data it produces. The signal-to-noise ratio of the CCD sensors  will always have more effect on the quality of the scanner’s output. A scanner with a  high signal-to-noise ratio and 30Bit colour depth will easily out perform a scanner  with 42Bit colour and a low signal-to-noise ratio (see later section in this report on  ‘Noise and Crosstalk’).  Recently, many low-end scanners are offering 36-42Bit A/D (analog-digital)  conversion although it is unlikely that the original source data created by the CCD  within the scanner is really of a high enough quality to benefit from the additional bit-depth.  Additional bit-depth allows a larger dynamic range to be captured by the  scanner, but does not ensure that it exists within the original data collected by the  CCD.",,2011-02-22,2011-02-22,http://cdm17409.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/oclcsample/id/83,83,84.pdfpage,/oclcsample/image/84.pdfpage

The maximum density of the deepest shadow is called the ‘dMax’ and the  minimum density of the clearest highlight the ‘dMin’. The Dynamic range is the  difference between both values:  Dynamic range is measured on a logarithmic scale of optical density (OD) from 0.0  for a ‘perfect’ white to 4.0 for a very dense black. The quoted ‘dynamic range’ gives  the range of OD values (between 0 – 4) that the scanner can distinguish. For a  ‘perfect’ scanner this would of course be 4.0 (or just over) but in reality no scanner  can come close, with cheaper flatbed scanners having a dynamic range of 2.5 –3.0  and even the very best of drum scanners only providing up to about 3.8. Of course  images in the real world do not have perfect blacks or whites either and normally  have a dynamic range well less than 4.0.  A scanner with a ‘dMin’ or 0.2 and a ‘dMax’ of 3.8 would have a dynamic range of  3.6.

oclcsample,coll0086,Page 5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Putting you in the picture – digital images in education © TASI · Last reviewed - July 2002  Noise and Crosstalk  ‘Noise’ is defined as any unwanted energy within the signal and all electronic devices  suffer to a greater or lesser extent. This unwanted energy may be caused by many  faults in the scanner design including inadequate electronic shielding of the CCD and  the use of cheaper components.  Noise is visible within a digital image as a grainy roughness within areas of very low  signal (shadows). Visually this appears much like the graininess of photographic  film. Often going unnoticed in 'routine' scanning, noise is most likely to show itself  when shadow areas of an image are lightened or have their contrast range  increased. If particularly bad, the noise can mask shadow detail and be visually  unpleasant.  The level of this ‘noise’ is quantified by the signal/noise (s/n) ratio. Many  manufacturers of low-end scanners prefer not to supply the s/n ratios for their  products due to their revealing nature. Figures should certainly exceed 60dB for  8Bit/colour and 75dB for 12Bit/colour. Scanners based on CCD technology are  particularly susceptible to noise and use various techniques to prevent it, such as  multi-passing, where the image is scanned multiple times before the results are  averaged to smooth out any apparent noise.  Crosstalk is a degradation of image quality where a flair appears around bright  highlights in the scanned image, especially in dark areas. It is caused by the highly  stimulated CCD elements (in the image highlights) distorting the readings in the  elements (in shadow) immediately adjacent to them. Again this is a problem more  associated with CCD technology than drum scanners. Crosstalk can be a real  problem with cheaper CCD flatbed scanners but does not normally affect more high-end  CCD flatbeds. Generally, crosstalk can only be discovered by testing the  scanner with a range of test images with adjacent highlight/shadow borders.  Scanning Speed  Scanning times vary greatly between comparable devices let alone scanners using  differing technology. Within a busy workflow, scanning speed can often be a  deciding factor in scanner choice and should always be researched and considered  before a choice is made. Many scanners offer a choice of differing qualities of scan  which are dependent upon the number of passes and/or speed of the CCD: the  more passes the CCD makes, the higher the quality and the slower the scanning  speed. Some early CCD scanners were unable to scan Red, Green and Blue data  in one go (one-pass) and had to make three separate scans (three-pass). This did  not affect the quality but was very slow; luckily these units are now very rare.  Scanning technology is steadily improving and this is reflected in scanners that are  becoming faster as well as providing higher quality. Of course as a general rule the  faster a scanner is the more productive it can be. This is reflected in the costs of  these units where faster scanners with higher productivity are considerably more  expensive than slower units.  Scan area  Most flatbed scanners have a nominal size of A4 but can scan an area of about 8.5""  by 12-14"". A3 sized scanners are available but they can take up a considerable  amount of space. They are, of course, essential if you need to capture large works  (over A4) although if the objects are very large or difficult to handle a digital camera  might well offer a more pragmatic alternative. Hi-end A3 flatbed scanners are very",,2011-02-22,2011-02-22,http://cdm17409.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/oclcsample/id/86,86,87.pdfpage,/oclcsample/image/87.pdfpage

This offers greatly increased  efficiency and increased throughput. It should be noted however that these  machines are very expensive and for maximum productivity, two machines should be  alternated so that one scanner can be loaded whilst the other is scanning and vice  versa.  Some flatbed scanners offer the addition of dual optics where the optical system can  be switched to scan a ‘sweet-zone’, which offers a smaller scan area with a greatly  increased resolution. This is normally of use when scanning small to medium sized  transparencies within the full size of the scanner bed.  Dedicated film scanners provide a scan area appropriate for the size of  slide/negative that they handle. Some additional productivity can be gained by the  use of additional add-ons such as the film-strip holder and other add-ons as  mentioned below.  Options  There is a range of optional add-on parts that can provide additional functionality and  productivity for many mid-range to high-end scanners. Two of the most common  options for flatbed scanners are the automatic sheet/transparency feeder (ASF/ATF)  and the transparency media adapter (TMA).  Automatic sheet/transparency feeder (ASF/ATF)  An ASF or ATF is used to batch scan quantities of single sheets or transparencies.  All originals must be the same size and will need to be scanned with automatic or  generic settings. Although these units offer high productivity with large throughput,  they will only work if the originals can be scanned without any individual attention.  It should also be remembered that the memory, storage and bandwidth requirements  are always high when scanning and these feeders can create enough digital data in  a small time period to require a computer, storage and network of the highest  specifications.  Normally ASF/ATF are best for creating small and low quality scans, either 1-Bit  Black and White images from text for later optical character recognition (OCR) or  small scans for thumbnail creation.  Transparency Media Adapter (TMA)  Low-end and consumer flatbeds have been designed and optimised for scanning  reflective artwork such as photos and drawings. However some can work with a  TMA that provides an alternative light source within the scanner, which enables  transparent artworks such as photo-slides and larger colour transparencies to be  scanned. These units can give acceptable results with larger transparencies.  However, in general, these cheaper flatbeds do not have the optical resolution (or  quality) to create large and high-quality scans from a 35mm photo slide. If you only  need small and low quality scans from slides/negatives, then a TMA may well  remove the need to buy a dedicated film scanner. However, if you want a  reasonable level of quality or have a steady flow of work, it will be necessary to buy a  scanner dedicated to the job.",,2011-02-22,2011-02-22,http://cdm17409.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/oclcsample/id/87,87,88.pdfpage,/oclcsample/image/88.pdfpage
oclcsample,coll0088,Page 7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Putting you in the picture – digital images in education © TASI · Last reviewed - July 2002  Interfaces  Until recently SCSI (Small Computer Serial Interface) has been the most common  scanner/computer interface. However there are now two new standards that appear  to be gaining support. USB 1 & USB2 (Universal Serial Bus), developed by an IT  industry consortium, and IEEE1394, known more commonly as Firewire (or iLink by  Sony).  Many high-end scanners are still using SCSI as an interface although FireWire is  quickly gaining common acceptance. Low-end scanners nearly all use USB, which  has now become a generic standard interface on all currently supplied computers  and operating systems.  USB and FireWire both offer the advantages of being hot-swappable, allowing  scanners to be connected and recognised whilst the computer is running; whereas  SCSI is considered a fragile technology that can be easily damaged by incorrect or  untimely connections to the computer. As a general rule, all SCSI devices should be  connected and turned on before their host computer is booted up.  SCSI, FireWire and USB are all evolving standards that offer higher speeds each  and every time a new version of the standard is released. At present the fastest  interface is still the latest SCSI interface, but in the future it is likely that Firewire and  USB 2 will catch up and pass SCSI in the speed stakes. However the speed of data  transfer is rarely a limiting factor on a scanner where the bottleneck is rarely the  interface and more often the scanning process itself.  Scanner Software  The scanning process is controlled by scanner software. As well as driving the  hardware that captures the image data and passes it on to the next stage of the  image workflow, this software usually offers a range of image processing features.  Scanner software can either be a device-specific program designed to work with one  scanner, or a plug-in based on a driver interface such as TWAIN or ISIS, which can  be accessed from within a host program.  The software can play an important role within a workflow in terms of productivity  and quality of the scan, so it is important to consider how best to combine the work  undertaken by scanning software with that done by image processing software.  In addition to setting resolution, scan area and colour/greyscale, scanner software  can be used to control:  ·  ICC colour profile creation  ·  Colour optimisation  ·  Colour transformation (e.g. RGB to CMYK)  ·  Film type colour correction  ·  Descreening (removal of the matrix of dots in printed material)  ·  Sharpening  ·  Tonal optimisation  ·  Automated dust/scratch removal",,2011-02-22,2011-02-22,http://cdm17409.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/oclcsample/id/88,88,89.pdfpage,/oclcsample/image/89.pdfpage

Additionally, a project’s workflow will have a bearing on which is more appropriate.  For example, some workflows may have a high throughput of similar image types  that can all be acquired using the same scanner software settings, adjusting each  image by the same criteria. Other projects may have a lower throughput, or may be  scanning a wider range of source material, where it would be more beneficial to keep  adjustment to a minimum at the time of capture and use image processing software  to fine-tune each image on an individual basis. Where higher levels of optimisation  are required, using an image manipulation program will be more versatile than  relying on scanner software alone.  Colour Management Systems  For many users, however high the quality or advanced the specification, the scanned  images are only useful, if it means that the colour gained from the scan is an honest  representation of the colour in the original.  These days many scanners come with some form of colour management software.  Normally this is based around ‘open loop’ colour management systems as proposed  by the International Colour Consortium (ICC).  In this system a standard colour test target (IT8.7/2) is scanned and the readings  taken to create an exact record of the scanners colour characteristics. This ICC  profile can then be used to accurately transform the colours within the original to a  standard ‘working colour space’ that the image can be edited in.  Low-end and consumer scanners do not normally have the ability to create their own  bespoke ICC colour profile but come supplied with a generic profile that has been  created by the manufacturer for that model of scanner. This will not be as accurate,  but should provide the chance of ‘truer’ colour than can be created without any  profile. ICC Colour Profile creation software can also be sourced separately,  allowing the creation of customised profiles for any scanner as well as colour profiles  for monitor and any output device. (A fuller explanation of Colour Management and  the ICC system can be found in TASI Notes: Colour Management and Targets  paper)",,2011-02-22,2011-02-22,http://cdm17409.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/oclcsample/id/89,89,90.pdfpage,/oclcsample/image/90.pdfpage
oclcsample,coll0090,Page 9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Putting you in the picture – digital images in education © TASI · Last reviewed - July 2002  Scanner types  The steady growth in digital imaging over the last five years has lead to a vast range  of professional and consumer scanners being available on the market. Quality and  speed are steadily rising across the board whilst the cost slowly falls. However it  remains true that although it is possible to buy fast low-quality scanners or slow high-quality  scanners at a cheaper price; productive and high-quality scanners tend to still  be very expensive.  Scanner technology  There are three main types of scanner, although they are based on only two  underlying internal technologies to convert light to a digital signal. The drum scanner  uses traditional Photo-multiplier Tube (PMT) technology whilst the flatbed and  transparency scanners use more recent Charge-coupled Device (CCD) technology.  The Drum Scanner  Drum scanners use photo-multiplier tubes (PMT) to produce very high quality results.  They typically have a Density Range of 3.4 – 4.0 with a ‘dMax’ at the top of that  range. They can offer an optical resolution of up to 8000 samples per inch (spi).  Drum scanners are the tool of choice of the print industry and normally only used by  professional digitisation bureaux. This is due both to their expense and their  complexity, requiring skilful operation to get the best from them.  Only flexible original artwork can be scanned in a drum scanner as it has to be  ‘mounted’ on a transparent acrylic cylinder (drum) and then spun at high speeds  around the photo-multipliers within the cylinder. Mounting transparencies on the  drum is a slow and skilled operation and it is normal to have at least two drums in  use so that one can be mounted whilst the other is being scanned.  Although the quality from these scanners is exemplary, they tend to be slow and  cannot normally provide the level of productivity required from most digitisation  projects. There are also some preservation issues with the standard use of a  ‘mounting oil’ to avoid ‘Newton’s rings’ between the transparency and the drum. If a  ‘mounting oil’ is used, then the transparencies must be scrupulously cleaned after  scanning. This is quite possible, although many owners will not wish to not run the  risk of treating their transparencies in this harsh way and will prefer to scan them on  a flatbed that can provide a far safer capture process.  Drum scanners typically cost many tens of thousands of pounds although there have  recently been a few desktop drum scanners introduced at a more affordable rate.  This kind of investment is only worthwhile within a highly commercial business  structure, but will offer superlative quality to those that invest the money and the time  to get the best out of them.  The Flatbed Scanner  Flatbed scanners use a linear CCD array, made up from a long line of charge-coupled  device elements in a row. The CCDs themselves can only detect the  presence or absence of light. To enable the scanner to capture colour, they must  either make three passes with a Red, Green or Blue filter in front of the CCD or have  3 lines of CCD each with either a red, green or blue filter on top.",,2011-02-22,2011-02-22,http://cdm17409.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/oclcsample/id/90,90,91.pdfpage,/oclcsample/image/91.pdfpage
oclcsample,coll0091,Page 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Putting you in the picture – digital images in education © TASI · Last reviewed - July 2002  Recently, CCD based scanners are much cheaper to produce than PMT based  scanners and also tend to be much easier to operate. They range from very cheap  and low-end consumer devices (as low as £50.00) right up to professional quality  devices with costs comparable with cheaper drum scanners (in the 10’s of  thousands).  Recently CCD technology has improved in leaps and bounds and within all price  ranges the quality has greatly improved. The most expensive professional flatbeds  are still cheaper than traditional drum scanners but can now easily provide scans to  a similar quality whilst cheaper scanners offer easy pragmatic image capture at a  correspondingly lower cost.  For the digitisation project one of the main advantages of the flatbed scanner is that  they are generally much simpler to use, allowing unskilled operators to effectively  use them without many weeks of extensive training. The flatbed scanner is also  much more acceptable in conservation terms as the original does not need to be  bent around a drum (and then taped down!), nor does it need any mounting oil to  avoid newton’s rings. Any artwork that can be safely placed face down flat on the  scanner can be quickly and easily scanned.  Flatbeds also offer much faster scanning times than drum scanners. This, along with  the lack of any required preparation (mounting transparency on drum with tape and  oil) makes it much easier to establish a productive and speedy workflow.  Most high-end flatbed scanners normally offer the ability to scan both reflective and  transparent originals (sometimes within a sweet-spot and sometimes over the whole  scanning area), whilst mid-range devices normally need a separate transparency  media adapter (TMA) to scan slides and transparencies. Most low-end flatbed  scanners are only able to scan reflective originals and even if they can be made to  work with transparencies are unlikely to have the necessary optical resolution to  provide anything more than the most basic quality.  The optical resolution of flatbed scanners is totally dependant on how much you  want to spend on them. High-end flatbeds are capable of producing 5,000 spi,  almost as high as comparably costing drum scanners, whilst at the low-end of the  spectrum, the available resolution of consumer devices appear to improve every  month and currently stands at around 1200spi.  The Transparency Scanner  Transparency and slide scanners again use CCD technology to scan original  transparencies. Rather than attempting to provide reasonable quality over a  comparatively large A4 bed these scanners are dedicated to just scanning a small  transparency to a high quality at a much higher resolution. This enables the device  to offer a much higher quality but still retain a reasonable price (although this tends  to be more comparable to mid-range scanners rather than the consumer range, from  £500 - £1000).  Transparency scanners can offer resolutions similar to high-end flatbeds with up to  5,000 spi although most low to mid-end transparency scanners typically scan at up  to about 3,000 spi for 135mm slides.  Typically these devices offer a much higher quality scan than can be made with a  low to med-end flatbed scanner but at a price much lower than the high-end flatbed.  They are easy and relatively fast to operate with options such as ‘Automatic  Transparency Feeders’ enabling them to provide highly productive workflows.",,2011-02-22,2011-02-22,http://cdm17409.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/oclcsample/id/91,91,92.pdfpage,/oclcsample/image/92.pdfpage

Summary  Scanners are without doubt the most common method of capturing digital images  from original analogue works and very few digitisation projects can manage without  at least one within their selection of input devices. They range in cost and capability  from basic consumer items right through to very expensive and specialised  professional devices. It is certainly advisable to undertake some rigorous research  to ascertain what the project requires from the scanner before any decision is made.  Remember the right scanner for one project is unlikely to be perfect for another  unless both happen to have an identical set of aims and a similar budget.  Whatever scanner is sourced for the project, it is worth considering that however  high the quality is of the scanner, this quality cannot be realised without a  correspondingly high level of skill from the operator. In fact, as a rule of thumb, the  higher the quality (and cost) of the scanner, the more skill will be needed from the  operator to realise the available quality. There is little point in investing a large  amount of a project’s budget in a high quality scanner, if there is no budget left to  pay for a skilled person to operate it and of course the reverse is going to be just as  true. There is no point in employing a highly skilled operator if you cannot afford a  scanner that will make best use of his/her skills.

The work was not commenced until  1857, and the capital has since been increased to one million of  dollars. The cost of construction is about $1,500,000; the  coet of the real estate, interest, taxes, and incidental expenses  will swell the amo~mt to about two millions of dollars.
